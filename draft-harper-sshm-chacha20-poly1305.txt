  Private Encryption Suite for SSH Using ChaCha20-Poly1305 Version 00
               draft-harper-sshm-chacha20-poly1305-latest

Abstract

   This document presents a new encryption suite,
   chacha20-poly1305-00@scssh.github.io, for the SSH protocol which
   utilizes ChaCha20 as the stream cipher and Poly1305 as the message
   authentication code.  By incorporating the Authenticated Encryption
   with Associated Data construction from RFC 7539, this design replaces
   the existing dependency on sequence numbers for Nonce generation,
   thus enhancing both security and operational efficiency.
